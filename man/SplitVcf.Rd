\title{A function to split a vcfR::VCF object in two vcfR::VCF object according to
a logical vector}
\usage{
SplitVcf(vcf, survivals, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{vcf}{The original vcfR::VCF object to split}

\item{survivals}{A logical vector for splitting the data into two vcfR::VCF
objects.
The length of the vector must match the number of samples in the VCF file.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE (default), report status of the process
along the execution.}
}
\value{
A list of vcfR:VCF objects.
\code{list$alive} is the vcfR::VCF object contains the samples which the position
corresponded with a TRUE in the \code{survivals} vector.
The other samples are contained in \code{list$dead} as an other vcfR::VCF object.
